# Employee Directory

Howard Stern Staff Employee Directory

## Overview
The goal was to create an employee directory with Reactjs. This assignment required the application's UI to be broken up into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. This was my first Reactjs application.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Functionality

When landing on the main page there is a list of the employees. The user can filter the employees by job title or sort by age. 

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
